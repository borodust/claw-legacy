# CLAW

**C**ommon **L**isp **a**uto**w**rapping facility for quickly creating
clean&lean bindings to C libraries (C++ support pending).

## Comparison

#### cl-autowrap
`:claw` started as a fork of awesome
[`cl-autowrap`](https://github.com/rpav/cl-autowrap/) library, but while the
idea is stayed the same it was almost completely rewritten to make it more
maintainable and to streamline it for goals I pursued - clean, very thin
performance-oriented (as less consing as possible, minimum overhead) bindings
generator.
