# claw

**C**ommon **L**isp **a**uto**w**rapping facility for quickly creating bindings to foreign
libraries with C-compatible ABI interface.

# cl-autowrap relationship
This is a fork of awesome [`cl-autowrap`](https://github.com/rpav/cl-autowrap/) library
streamlined for making simple wrappers over C libraries.


### Differences
Feature | `cl-autowrap` | `claw` |
--------|---------------|--------|
Foreign symbols | Included by default | Excluded by default |
Struct-by-value | via `libffi` | via autogenerated `C` wrapper |
Foreign symbols filtering | compile time | `.spec` generation time |
`.spec` formatting | pretty-printed VCS friendly | compact |
Foreign types introspection | yes | no |
Default platforms | many | x86_64/i686 GNU/Linux, macOS, Windows |
`CL`<->`C` string autoconversion | yes | no |

`claw` pros over `cl-autowrap`:
* simplified interface
* cleaner resulting wrapper due to default filtering rule
* faster invocation of functions that pass structs/unions by value
* small `.spec` size
* tailored to work in `GNU` environments on Windows (`msys2`), GNU/Linux and macOS
* maintained by `borodust`

`claw` cons:
* maintained by `borodust`
* maintained by `borodust`
* not maintained by `rpav`
* needs `C` wrapper for struct-by-value functions

# Example
Please, have a look at [`bodge-chipmunk`](https://github.com/borodust/bodge-chipmunk) wrapper.
